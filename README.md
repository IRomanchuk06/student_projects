# Student Projects

Welcome to the repository containing my student projects completed as part of my academic program. Here, you will find works that showcase my programming skills and algorithms.

## Projects

### 1. Priority Queue

This project implements a priority queue, allowing for the management of elements based on their importance. Various data structures are used for efficiently handling insertion, deletion, and search operations. Key features include:

- Support for different priority levels.
- Efficient algorithms for operations.
- An intuitive interface for interaction.

### 2. Multiset

The multiset project implements a collection that allows for storing duplicate elements. It supports operations such as adding, removing, and searching for elements, and provides methods for handling multiple instances of a single value. Key features:

- Efficient implementation using standard containers.
- Methods to retrieve information about the count of each element.
- Support for various operations on multisets.
